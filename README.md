Predicting Credit Card Approvals Using Machine Learning
 Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or denied based on applicant information. By leveraging historical data and various ML algorithms, this system can help financial institutions make faster and data-driven decisions, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report.Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming,this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
